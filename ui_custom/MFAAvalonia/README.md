# LAA MFAAvalonia customization

This directory keeps the reproducible UI patch used by LAA. It targets upstream
MFAAvalonia commit `6065fe33798b72906c5079fa6f210646801d9a5c` (v2.15.2).

The patch adds the in-process chip filter plan editor opened from the settings
gear beside `ChipDetailReadTask`. Runtime plan data stays in
`config/chip_filter_plan.json`; build output and NuGet caches stay outside the
repository on the E drive.

The three lock-mode labels remain visible at all times. The current main skill
is shown as a solid green button: click to select it and double-click to edit.
The editor can copy its conditions to selected unconfigured skills, or clear
only the active main-skill level after confirmation.

Run `build.ps1` after cloning the matching upstream source into
`E:\LAA\MFAAvalonia-src`. The script applies the patch when needed, builds the
UI, and copies only `MFAAvalonia.Core.dll` into the local `gui/libs` directory.
